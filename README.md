# NgRx Component Store Experiment

This project is to show a two stage exploration of NgRx Component Store, as compared to using a BehaviourSubject to store local state in a view model object.

The demo code for this branch is in [App](https://github.com/tomwhite007/ngrx-component-store-experiment/blob/main/apps/playground/src/app/book-manager/book-manager.component.ts), inside a Nrwl Nx Workspace. I used Nx because it comes with an excellent schematic for scaffolding the global NgRx state - so I could make this demo quicker.

This branch contains an example app (Book App) using NgRx Component Store to store local state in a view model object.
